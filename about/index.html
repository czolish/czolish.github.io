	<h1 class="page-title">About Me</h1>
	<p>Hi! My name's Kim, I'm in my early 30's, and obviously I'm amazing at writing 'about me' pages ;)</p>
	<p>I was born and raised in the Bay Area, specifically North San Jose, where there used to be nothing but mustard flowers, little critters, and Cisco. I attended UC Santa Cruz, where I obtained my bachelor's degree in Environmental Studies in 2015. Since then, I've worked in education administration, but I am currently pursuing a career in Environmental Planning.</p>
	<p>I'm also very interested in web development and I'm trying to teach myself JavaScript, JQuery, REACT, and Rails. There's definitely a huge learning curve!</p>
