We moved to the city of Santa Cruz in September of 2013 to attend UCSC. I had some leftover financial aid funds from community college, and I worked all summer, so we were able to move in a month before classes started. We were so in love with the area at first! It was so much prettier than where we used to live, and it seemed really quaint and quiet. The apartment we found was the middle unit of a triplex, and it was a little rough around the edges, but it was bright and roomy, and it was in the perfect location -- right off the bus line that we took to class. We moved in before the apartment was finished, and we had to live a day without hot water, but we were finally living on our own! It was awesome!

Then, after a short while, things started to go downhill, and we realized how much Santa Cruz sucks. Here are a few reasons why:

## 1. Santa Cruz has a HUGE drug problem.
Anywhere you walk downtown, especially on the River Walk along the San Lorenzo River, you will see a bunch of cracked out homeless people. Not that all of the homeless people here are cracked out, but the most visible ones are definitely doing *something*. We lived on the 'west side' with all the million dollar homes (our apartment was really cheap for the area, surprisingly), and we would get woken up in the middle of the night to the sounds of crazy people walking up and down the street *screaming*. My brother's car was broken into multiple times, and the neighbors once called the cops because they found a homeless person sleeping in his car. They would steal his knickels and dimes -- that's how desperate they were. Every time I read the local newspaper, there was a headline about how someone was caught with drug paraphenalia, meth, and weapons. There were a couple of 'honey oil lab' explosions (really, if they just fucking regulated it then people wouldn't be blowing themselves up, but ok DEA, ban it and see how many more explosions there will be) in the first year that we lived here also. 

## 2. There's also a huge homeless population.
The majority of the homeless population is just down on their luck, but, continuing from my first point, a lot of them are also alcoholics or drug addicts. I work down the street from a park where lots of homeless people hang out and do drugs (also where people take their children for swimming lessons or baseball games -- pretty nice, right?). I would sit in my car by the park and eat lunch, and I would see someone selling drugs *every single day*, but the cops don't patrol that area. They only patrol areas where people are speeding because that's where the money is. There are a lot of programs to help homeless people get back on their feet, and I'm assuming they drug test people before offering them services, but there are still a lot of people around Santa Cruz who continue to believe that offering those services are what is causing all these drug-addicted people to come to the city (which is complete and utter bullshit). From what I have seen, a lot of the residents here just don't want to do anything to help solve the homeless issue.

## 3. Housing costs are ridiculous.
When we first moved here, our rent was $1675 per month, including water and garbage. Our utility bill didn't really ever get higher than $75, and that was in the winter months when we would run our space heaters. We were lucky in that our landlord didn't raise the rent too much each year. When we moved out, we were paying $1935, which was still not that bad.
