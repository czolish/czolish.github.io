I have worked for a County Office of Education in California for about 2 years now. I got this job about a month after I had graduated from college -- all bright-eyed and ready for the working world. As you can imagine, things haven't turned out exactly as I had envisioned them. Here is a list of a few of the things I have learned during my time as a public servant:

## 1.  People really love their titles here.
I have changed forms several times within a year because someone's titled changed from 'whatever' to 'SENIOR whatever'. That is a ridiculous amount of paper wasted.

## 2.  Regardless of someone's status, whether they're a student's parents or a superintendent from a school district, they will talk down to you because you're at the front desk, and somehow that equates to you being an idiot.
This is what gets me the most. I also have a degree. I'm not just another pretty face with no brain. This is not my chosen career, either. This is a stepping stone onto bigger and better things. It also pays the bills (or some of them, at least -- the real estate market around here is a whole other story).

## 3. There's a ridiculous amount of spam calls.
They come from all kinds of different places. Most of them are from call centers and you can tell it's a spam call because there's a weird click before someone spouts off their little script. There are a lot of debt collectors, whether they're legitimate or not, I don't know. White Pages Reverse Phone Lookup has become a very good friend of mine.

## 4. People think all we do all day is sit here and wait for them, and only them, to come to the office.
I can't tell you how many times someone has left me a voicemail full of hatred because I wasn't there at 5:30 p.m. I also get calls on the weekend from people expecting an immediate response. Here's a bit of news for them: I don't give a crap about how quickly you need to see someone. I am not coming in on the weekends just to help you, you precious snowflake. It's not my fault that you couldn't manage to call during the 45 hours a week that I am here (yes, I'm counting lunch).

## 5. You can't kick people out because it's a public building.
Technically, I can't kick people out. The building I work in is located down the street from 'Meth Central' and we occasionally get a few scragglers. Not too many, but enough to worry. 

## 6. It really pays off to be nice to the IT guys.
I mean, this is just obvious, but I feel like I can relate to the IT guys. People are asking them stupid questions all day, they act like their problem is more important than anyone else's problem, they can't Google their issue first, so on and so forth. If you're nice to the IT guys, they're less likely to get pissed off when you screw something up. They also are more likely to turn the other cheek if you're writing your blog while on the clock.

## 7. People can't follow directions (yea, I know, huge shocker).
How hard is it to understand '*DOWN* the hall, make a *RIGHT*'??? I mean, should I print a map out for every idiot who walks through the door?? And teachers are the biggest perpetrators! I send them a list with very specific instructions that are beyond easy to follow, yet they miss crucial pieces of information. I mean, I know California has a teacher shortage, but are they just *handing* out teaching credentials??

## 8. You can't correct people, even when they're in the wrong.
When a child misbehaves, you correct their behavior. If an adult misbehaves, apparently you just take it because they're allowed to treat others like shit.

## 9. People think you do nothing -- even people in your own department.
Granted, a lot of the time is down time, especially during the summer (why don't we close again??), but I do actually have work to do. It takes a surprising amount of time to do everything that I need to do (everything mail-related, updating the schedules, returning calls, making appointments, greeting people, etc.) when I'm constantly being interrupted.

## 10. Everyone who works here has been here for probably 2 decades.
And of course, they know better than you because they went to secretarial school in the 80's. If you don't wear makeup, you're an un-ladylike heathen!

## 11. People just suck.
Don't get me wrong. The majority of the people who walk through the doors are really good, kind people, but the assholes ruin it for everyone. For some reason, you rarely remember the nice ones, but the assholes always stick out, even if there's fewer of them. We have this program that gives backpacks to low-income and homeless families. This program is *totally* necessary for those who couldn't otherwise afford backpacks and the endless amount of school supplies that children are required to have these days, but there are some people who are just soooo ungrateful. There was a parent who *refused* to take a backpack full of supplies because they didn't like the color of the one they received. There was another family, with **5 children**, who received **5 backpacks** FULL of stuff, and then they tried to steal school supplies that were meant for special education classrooms. I mean, *really*? Your **5 backpacks** weren't enough?? I just see so many shitty people come through here. So many unappreciative, greedy people. It really makes it difficult to like human beings.
