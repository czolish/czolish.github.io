	<h1 class="page-title">Hi there!</h1>
	<p>My name's Kim and welcome to my personal site! It's slowly evolving, but hopefully I'll have a really cool end product once I learn more about web development!</p>
	<p>A little more about me, I was born and raised in the Bay Area and I attended UC Santa Cruz, where I obtained my bachelor's degree in Environmental Studies in 2015. Since then, I've worked in education administration, but I am currently pursuing a career in Environmental Planning.</p>
	<p>I'm also very interested in web development and am trying to teach myself JavaScript, JQuery, React, and Rails. There's definitely a lot to learn!</p>
